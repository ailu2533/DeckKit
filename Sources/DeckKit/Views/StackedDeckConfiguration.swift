       - alwaysShowLastCard: Whether or not to show the last card for visual stability, by default `true`.
       - scaleOffset: The percentual factor to shrink cards for each step down the stack, by default `0.02`.
       - verticalOffset: The vertical offset to apply to cards for each step down the stack, by default `10`.
       - dragRotationFactor: The offset factor with which to rotate a card when it's panned, by default `0.05`.
       - horizontalDragThreshold: The number of points a card must be panned to be moved to the bottom of the deck, by default `100`.
       - verticalDragThreshold: The number of points a card must be panned to be moved to the bottom of the deck, by default `250`.
